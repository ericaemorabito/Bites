# Bites

## Description
 
* Ducks is a review site for chefs, line cooks, bakers, stewards and even FOH staff to check in to see what others have said about a restaurant before hitting the apply button.

- This project taught me more about Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.
- This project also taught me how to integrate data using Handlebars.
